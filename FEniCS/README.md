# Scientific-Softwares-Installation-Scripts

There is a plethora of technical software available that can be challenging to install. Having faced this issue myself, I opted to create installation scripts for each program. If you've encountered similar obstacles while attempting to install software necessary for your academic pursuits, feel free to reach out to me at `sa.zarrinpour@yahoo.com` with the subject line `Software Installation Problem`. 

It's important to note that I'm unable to assist with software that requires a paid license unless you can provide me with said license.
